## A Movary frontend to display the latest addition to your watchlist. 

#### You'll need to setup a .env file in the root of your Node folder.

Required Env Vars:

```PORT``` -- Application port. 

```MOVERY_BASE_URL``` -- Movary URL

```API_CLIENT_STRING``` -- Application identifier string

```USER_EMAIL``` -- The user email account that has the watch list

```USER_PASSWORD``` -- User Password

```USER_ID``` -- User ID number

```NEXT_DT``` -- Datetime of the next showtime. eg: '2025-09-13T22:00:00.000Z'

Start the app as you would a normal node application. 

Containerization coming soon!
